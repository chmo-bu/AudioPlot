# UPyPlot
### Plot Unity script variables in realtime using MatPlotLib

**What is it:**
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guiglass/UPyPlot/master/SceneLayout.png)

The intention of this example was to build an easy to use plotting tool for visualizing the values generated by an AI controller and see how it's PID loops were affecting the vehicle causing it overshooting/undershooting issues.

_This tool was designed to help diagnose multiple variables across multiple scripts as quickly and painlessly as possible._

**Prerequisite:**
* This was built using Unity 2017, but earlier versions sould support the features.
* Python 2.7 with MatPlotLib and NumPy installed.

**How to use:**
It's simple to add plotting to any private or public variable in a script. This is done by adding the **[UPyPlot.UPyPlotController.UPyProbe]** custom attribute to the variable decloration, after which you should see that value listed in the plot viewer.

**_Integrating with your project:_**

* Copy the UPyPlot folder and all of it's contents from this example's assets folder to your projects assets folder.
* Place the UPyPlotController prefab into your scene.
* Ensure the output filename matches what is set in PlotViewer.py (default is plot.txt).
* Add the [UPyPlot.UPyPlotController.UPyProbe] attribute to any variable you want shown in the plot.
* Run both the PlotViewer.py Python file and start your scene (in any order). 
* Enjoy.
