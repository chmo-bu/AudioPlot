# UPyPlot
### Unity Python Plotting - Script variables to realtime MatPlotLib visualization


![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guiglass/UPyPlot/master/SceneLayout.png)

**What is it:**

The intention of this example was to build an easy to use plotting tool for visualizing the values generated by AI controllers and to see how their PID loops were affecting vehicles causing them to overshoot/undershoot or act undesirably.

_This tool was designed to help diagnose multiple variables from multiple scripts simultaneously, with rapid implementation and minimal user code modification requirements kept in mind._

**Prerequisites:**

* Example was created using Unity 2017, but earlier versions should support the feature set.
* Python 2.7 with MatPlotLib and NumPy installed.
* The was only tested on C# scripts.

**How to use:**

It's pretty straight forward to add the probe attribute and works with just about any private or public variable. To probe a variable just add a  **[UPyPlot.UPyPlotController.UPyProbe]** custom attribute to the variable decloration, after which you should see that variable in the plot. Thats it.

**_Integrating with your own project:_**

* Copy the UPyPlot folder and all of it's contents from this example's assets folder to your projects assets folder.
* Place the UPyPlotController prefab into your scene.
* Ensure the output filename matches what is set in PlotViewer.py (default is plot.txt).
* Add the [UPyPlot.UPyPlotController.UPyProbe] attribute to any variable you want shown in the plot.
* Run the PlotViewer.py Python file and start your scene (in any order). 
* Enjoy.


**Configuration:**
At present the tool offers some configurability such as:

* Precision - _Number of decimal places for each value in the plot data file._
* Interval - _Rate in seconds which to update plot data file with new values._
* Max Samples - _Maximum lines/history that the plot file should contain._


**Advanced Viewer (UPyPlotAdvancedViewer.py):**

I have also added a second Python script (similar to the basic viewer) that has an additional button for changing the plot style. This allows selecting between a single plot style where all lines are combined on a single axes and scale, and another where each line is on it's own individual plot axes:

_Note that the individual mode appears to update at a slightly reduced rate when compared to the combined mode. I may address this in a future update._
